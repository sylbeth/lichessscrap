# Lichess Scrapper
This repository was made as a means to analyze and reestructure the data from the [Lichess.org Database](https://database.lichess.org/), whose data is licensed under the [Creative Commons CC0 license](https://database.lichess.org/).

This project attempts to build a sensible relational database from that data, making some assumptions and conversions from the formats in the original file to formats that are easier to work with, so that it can later be used to make data analysis on it.
